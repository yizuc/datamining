    "Python incorporates *many* packages to support a wide range of tasks. Some of these packages are maintained by the same people that work on the Python programming language. Others are created by 3rd party teams. There are packages to do basic tasks like simple math and telling time. Other packages are used mainly for handling data, to do scientific computing, or machine learning. For the homework assignments, we generally focused on 2 or 3 packages (usually with helpful hints!). In this notebook, we are going to introduce some additional  packages that may be useful for you going forward.\n",

You can use `time` and `datetime` to keep track of how long it takes to run certain tasks or to format dates and times. The `os` and `sys` packages let you make calls to the computer's operating system and access programs outside of Python (e.g. the command line!). You can use `math` to do mathematical operations slightly more advanced than addition, subtraction, etc. (e.g. exponentiation). The `re` package lets you use regular expressions."

Very often \"structured\" corresponds to being organized in a common database structure (essentially one or more possibly related tables). \n",

    "\n",
    "- **.csv or .tsv** - Can be thought of as rows and columns, where each column will represent a single feature. All rows should have a value for each column (although some analytics methods will deal with blanks).\n",
    "- **JSON** - Looks similar to Python dictionaries. Each row can have an unordered list of `key:value`s\n",
    "- **XML** - Tagging language that looks something like HTML. More similar to JSON than to csv or tsv.\n",
    "- **A full-blown relational database** -- A relational database has tables for entities and for relationships, with keys (identifiers) related the tables to each other.  Examples of common databases are mysql and commercial databased provided by Oracle, Microsoft, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of any of these data types might seem straightforward, but there can be tons of complications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A file ending in `.csv` does *not* mean that it will be well structured. It is still just a text file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a data file in the `/data/` folder called `strings_*.csv`. This csv file has no header. However, we know the columns are: 'age', 'satisfaction', 'location', 'time_spent', 'income', 'bio', 'purchased'. Let's see it:\n"

Here is a brief overview of the modeling methods for classification (regression overview would be similar).\n",

Our main \"tool\" (technique) to evaluate and avoid overfitting is by splitting the data, and then training and evaluating on different portions.  We can do this via a single train/test split, or via cross validation. Both of these methods are, again, built into sklearn."

    "By default, all the modeling procedures we use in sklearn have some settings that manage how complex they allow the resulting models to be. We've studies quite a few of these complexity parameters (usually called hyper-parameters). The act of finding the \"best\" parameter is usually done through a procedure of \"hyper-parameter tuning\".  \n",

Since hyper-parameter tuning is part of learning a model, if you don't separate out the final test set, you run the risk of not judging the overfitting done by the overall procedure.  *We sometimes ignore this when first learning about hyper-parameter tuning, because it is complicated.  You should not ignore it when applying these methods in practice.*\n",
