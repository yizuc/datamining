        "One of the most underappreciated tools for dealing with data is the command line of the unix/linux operating system. As you probably know, an operating system runs computer-based devices, including servers, laptops, smartphones, and many others, usually \"under the hood\".   \"Unix\" is the family of operating systems that runs the most devices.  If you have a Mac -- there's Unix under the hood.  An iPhone?  Unix under the hood. An Android phone? Guess what ... Unix under the hood.  And what are you running on now?  You guessed it. (But Windows machines?  Not Unix.)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can get under the hood of a Unix-based computer via the command line, often called the Terminal, and do all manner of crazy things.  We will study a few of them.\n",

There are actually different shells with different commands & syntax, even for the same operating system, but we won't delve into that in this class.  We will use the particular shell that Jupyterhub provides us by default.  The default is the \"bash\" shell, for those of you who care.)\n",

If you're serious about dealing with data, and you don't have much command-line experience, you should get the book \"Data Science at the Command Line\" by Janssens.

You will typically use commands such as `ls` (list directory contents) and `cd` (change to another directory--but wait on that for a second). You can make a directory with `mkdir` or move (`mv`) and copy (`cp`) files. To delete a file you can `rm` (remove) it--careful, there's no getting it back.  To see the contents of a file you can `cat` it to the screen.  (Why `cat`?  That command actually concatenates multiple files and outputs the result.  If you give it one, then it just outputs that single file.  The default is to output it to the screen.  You'll see below that we can send command outputs elsewhere besides to the screen--like into another command!)\n",

        "Many commands have options you can set when running them. For example to get a listing of files as a vertical list with extra details you can pass the `-l` (list) flag, e.g. `ls -l`. During the normal course of using the command line, you will learn the most useful flags. If you want to see all possible options you can always read the `man` (manual) page for a command, e.g. `man ls`. When you are done reading the `man` page, you can exit by hitting `q` to quit.\n"
